# Nimbly Theme
A very nimble and easy-to-use WordPress theme by [Blake Bertuccelli].

### General Theme Customizations
Nimbly includes a number of simple customizations. WordPress Administors can add a logo, update a background image, change segment titles, insert social media links, and add tracking codes using the WP Customizer under the Appearance menu. Nimbly also includes customizable widget areas in the footer and the abuility to add a custom header menu.

Developers can further customize Nimbly with standard [WordPress Action Hooks]. Hooks can be added to a plugin or to the file "custom_functions.php" in the "includes" folder. *Nimbly-specific Action Hooks coming soon...*

### Post Customizations
Hero media can be added to each post or page and Nimbly includes a special sidebar meta section where users can add maps, images, or embed video content. All this custom content can be updated with editing any post or page.

### Custom Post Archives
Nimbly includes two templates for archive pages. When editing any page, select which template you want to use from the post layout dropdown. The "Custom Hero Archive" is a full width, responsive layout that emphasises images. The "Standard Archive" displays posts and excerpts in two fixed columns. Limit posts in the archives to a particular categories by updating the "Archive Categories" field. 

### Included Plugins
This theme includes the free [Advanced Custom Fields] plugin (version 4.4.3) and the [ACF Repeater Field plugin] (version 1.1.1). Nimbly also includes configured classes for the [Gravity Forms] plugin, and the [Font Awesome] icon font.

### Design & Style
The design and style for Nimbly was inspired by the [Media Temple blog], which is built to standard Flat Design fundamentals. 

### Contributing to Nimbly
This is an Alpha release of Nimbly. Features may be completely reinvisions and bugs may still need to be squashed. Feedback is mightily appreciated.

Thanks!
